# High-Pass-Filtering
Performing high-pass filtering on an image can be computationally intensive,
especially if the image is large and the filter is complex.
To speed up the process and take advantage of parallel processing,
you can use multi-processors to distribute the workload across multiple cores or nodes

multi-processors can significantly speed up the process of high-pass filtering an image.
By breaking the image down into smaller chunks and distributing the workload across multiple processors,
you can achieve faster processing times and take full advantage of the available computing resources
